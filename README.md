### Description:
  * On the Welcome page you can switch between light and dark mode, and see the trainer ID card, or choose to edit it.
    * If you choose to edit the ID card, you can also see other information of the trainer.
  * Clicking "View Pokemon List" will take you to a list of pokemon cards from a json site
    * The Pokemons are listed in alphabetical order with the set series next to them
    * Choosing a Pokemon card will show the card image, average sell price, what it evolve from and to, and the logo of the set series
### Problems Encountered:
* Biggest problem I had was accessing data from the json and printing them in desired format
* Stack/Section/Form views, background
* Save button that will return back to welcome page
